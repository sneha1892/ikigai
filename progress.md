# Ikigai App Development Progress

This document tracks the development progress, approach, and current status of the Ikigai habit-tracking application.

## 1. Our Approach

Our core mission is to build a minimalist, mobile-first habit tracker centered around the "Ikigai" philosophy. The app helps users achieve holistic life improvement by balancing habits across Four Pillars of Well-being: Mental, Physical, Social, and Intellectual/Purpose.

**Technical Approach:**
- **Frontend:** A modern stack using React, Vite, and TypeScript.
- **Backend:** Firebase for core services, including Firestore for the database and Firebase Authentication for user management.
- **Styling:** A custom, in-house design system that implements Material Design principles for a clean, dark-themed UI. We are currently migrating from an older CSS implementation to this new, more robust token-based system.

## 2. What We've Done So Far

We have completed several key milestones, laying a solid foundation for the application.

### Foundational Setup:
- **Project Initialized:** The Vite + React + TypeScript project is fully configured.
- **Firebase Integration:** Firebase is connected, with Firestore (`firestore.ts`) and Auth (`AuthContext.tsx`) services implemented and in use.
- **Core App Structure:** The main application shell (`App.tsx`) with a three-tab navigation system is complete.

### Feature Implementation:
- **User Authentication:** A complete login flow (`Login.tsx`) is in place.
- **Onboarding Experience:** A multi-step quiz (`QuizContainer.tsx`) has been created to guide new users and suggest initial habits.
- **Habit & Task Management:** The core logic for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting habits and tasks is implemented on the `HabitsAndTasks.tsx` page.
- **Goal Setting:** Users can create and manage long-term goals via the `AddGoalModal.tsx`.
- **Notifications:** The app integrates with Firebase Cloud Messaging to request permission and handle push notifications.

### Design System Migration:
- **Phase 1 Complete:** We have successfully built the foundational layer of our new design system.
    - A token-based system for colors, spacing, and typography (`src/styles/design-system.ts`).
    - A `ThemeContext` for managing light/dark modes with persistence.
    - A library of base UI components (`Button`, `Card`, `Input`).
    - The main app shell and settings page have been migrated to this new system.

## 3. Current Focus & Issues

Our immediate focus is on completing the UI migration and refining the core user experience.

- **Component Migration to Design System:** We are in Phase 2 of the migration. The next high-priority components to update are:
    1. `Navigation.tsx`
    2. `TaskItem.tsx`
    3. All modal components (`QuickAddModal`, `AddGoalModal`, etc.)

- **Refining `HabitsAndTasks.tsx`:** This page is the heart of the app, and we are actively working on improving its functionality and UI. This includes ensuring a clear distinction and smooth user flow between recurring "habits" and one-off "tasks".
